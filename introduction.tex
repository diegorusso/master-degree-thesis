\chapter{Introduction}
In the recent years we have been witnessing an incredible increase of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications and services.
Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have been outperforming other
classical AI algorithms in many fields, like face recognition and natural
language processing.

This has been possible thanks to the explosion of data availability and compute
power, both needed and essential for ``training'' these neural networks.
Once the neural network has been trained, it can be used for the target that it
has been trained for: this phase is called ``inference''.
In \autoref{sec:training} I explain more in details these phases and what lies
in between.

Applications that requires some intelligence are computation intensive
demanding CPU, GPU, memory hence power out of the device and this makes the
application not always available to the end user.
In the last years the performance of these devices has been getting better and
better but still not sufficient for all more compute intensive applications.

The solution is to have a centralised data management and processing
(see~\ref{fig:centralised_intelligence}): the device collects data, send the
data to the cloud for processing and it receives back a response to their
request. This is called \textbf{centralised intelligence}.
Although this design is the basis of many applications, it presents some
drawbacks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{amount of data}: the data generated by the device is sent to
        the cloud for processing. The amount of this data is not trivial and
        this could put under stress communication channels.
    \item \textbf{persistent connection}: in order to have a working
        application a persistent network connection between the device and the
        cloud computing is required.
    \item \textbf{real-time}: some applications cannot function properly when
        in presence of latency introduced by the communication between the
        device and cloud and any delay in processing the request by the cloud.
    \item \textbf{data privacy}: the device might send personal data to the
        cloud exposing privacy issues in case of hacking of leaking of
        information from the cloud provide.
\end{itemize}

In order to overcome to the above issues, a different approach is needed where
the data processing is not centralised but distributed closer where it is
generated: this different approach is called \textbf{edge computing},
Computing, storage and networking resources are located at the edge of the
network (IoT gateways, routers, etc\ldots) whilst end devices like mobile
phones and IoT devices request services from edge servers are called edge
devices.
It is easy to understand how this approach can address some of the issues in
the centralised intelligence: low latency between edge devices and edge servers
and data exchange and data privacy are some how mitigated.

If we push a little more the design, the basis of edge computing combined with
AI creates what is called
\textbf{edge or mobile intelligence} (see~\ref{fig:edge_intelligence}).

This means that the data collection, caching, processing and analysis happens
on the device where the data is generated.
With this model latency, data privacy, network load and communication are all
contained and improved, giving a better experience to the end user.

With more powerful end devices we start having edge intelligence applications
in our pockets like smart suggestions on the keyboards based on the context of
the text, photos application with integrated face recognition (note: no
personal data is sent to the cloud) based on contacts stored on the mobile and
voice recognition commands for offline translation and on mobile actions.~\cite{xu:2020}

In this thesis I focus mainly on the edge inference (~\ref{fig:edge_inference})
and specifically how the models can be optimised in order to reduce memory
footprint, size and compression without losing any accuracy in the prediction.

\todo{Few more words about edge inference}

In \autoref{sec:training} I give an overview of the entire flow of an
intelligence application giving a brief explanation of every step of the flow.

In \autoref{sec:MO} I explain the main techniques for model optimization for
deployment, explaining what they are, pros and cons.

In \autoref{ch:pruning} I show the pruning technique more in details and
the section \autoref{sec:heuristic} illustrate the theory behind the per-layer
pruning configuration with heuristic.

In \autoref{ch:implementation} I show the code I have implemented in
TensorFlow Model Optimization giving full explanation and some working
examples.

Finally in \autoref{ch:results} I report experiment results on few well known
neural networks showing the benefits of this approach.
